                        <p class="blackbox">This was one of the first projects Idid that made me realise that I have an eye for details 
                            I made sure to get the same design and the same layout on the landing page but I did a little freestyle and took over in the sign up section 
                            this was also one of the early projects I worked on that did not take me up to a day or two to start and finish 
                            just reminds me how much I love the work that I do.

                        <h3>Pet Adoption App</h3>
                        <p class="blackbox">This project is more of a memorable project to me than one of my latest.
                            it was the very first tasking react app I had done, It uses an API to fetch the data of some pets 
                            according to the type of animal the breed and the location. The UI design was not a proble for me at all 
                            a nig proble I actually had was in fetching the data and I overcame that. A lot of reusable components were made 
                            which I am very proud of which makes my code readable and used in other projecsts.

                        this is a website landing page I am particularly proud of because of the beautiful
                        ui design and the smooth integration of the API, it is very easy to navigate and it goes staright to the point and passes
                        the right information which is what I believe to bethemain purpose of a landing page.

                <h3>Restaurant website</h3>
                <p class="blackbox">This may sound touchy feelings by building a website for my aunt but realy I wanted
                    to test my skills which is why I decided to build this purely out of Bootstrap
                    and i get some good project ideas when it is personal and this is.
                    This was one of the bootstrap projects I built mainly out of bootstrap.
                    I had the idea to make this because she did not have one for her business so i identified that 
                    as problem and came up with a fix.
                    This project was built purely with bootstrap and is completely reusable with clean code.

                <h3>Security code generator and validator</h3>
                <p class="blackbox">This is a project idea that really just hit me 
                    and that is why it is one of the lucky ones up here.
                    I got the idea from my the problems my estate was having, i identified the problem and offered to fix it.
                   It works like a standard coge generator and reader.
                    A code is then generated and saved to the database under the column of the user.
                    The code generated is sent to the visitor who then reads it out to the security personel at the gate.
                    The security personel then validates the code by running through a validator that checks the entire table in the database
                    if found the response would be valid, if not found "Not valid!" should pop up on the screen. <br><a onclick="Alert()" href="#">Click to see this project</a> <br>

            <h3>Real Estate agency website</h3>
            <p class="blackbox">This was another project to test my kills with bootstrap and it came out beautifully if 
                I do say so myself. It was another project I took opon myself when this client of mine had a business and with no 
                website.So I went commando and did the design and built the entire website and exceeded the expectations of my client.
                That is one of the major reasons I enjoy coding, seeing my designs and projects make a difference in life.
